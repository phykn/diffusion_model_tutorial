    "### Reparameterization trick\n",
    "Since sampling data from a probability distribution is a stochastic process, backpropagating gradients is not possible. To make it trainable, the reparameterization trick is commonly used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume that $\\mathbf{z}$ is sampled data from a Gaussian distribution with mean $\\mathbf{\\mu}$ and variance $\\mathbf{\\sigma^{2}}$, $\\mathcal{N}(\\mathbf{\\mu}, \\mathbf{\\sigma}^{2} \\mathbf{I})$. Then, the distribution of $\\mathbf{z}$ can be expressed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{z} = \\mathbf{\\mu} + \\mathbf{\\sigma} \\odot \\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$ is another random variable sampled from a standard Gaussian distribution, $\\mathcal{N}(0,\\mathbf{I})$, and $\\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication. By this reparameterization, we can now backpropagate gradients through $\\mathbf{z}$ since it is now a deterministic function of $\\mathbf{\\mu}$, $\\mathbf{\\sigma}$, and $\\boldsymbol{\\epsilon}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean and variance of $\\mathbf{z}$ are equal to $\\mathbf{\\mu}$ and $\\mathbf{\\sigma^{2}}$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expectation\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "E[\\mathbf{z}] &= E[\\mathbf{\\mu} + \\mathbf{\\sigma} \\odot \\mathbf{\\epsilon}] \\\\\n",
    "&= E[\\mathbf{\\mu}] + \\sigma E[\\mathbf{\\epsilon}] \\\\\n",
    "&= \\mathbf{\\mu}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The expectation of $\\mathbf{\\epsilon}$ is 0 by definition, since it is a standard normal distribution with a mean of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variance\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "Var[\\mathbf{z}] &= Var[\\mathbf{\\mu} + \\mathbf{\\sigma} \\odot \\mathbf{\\epsilon}] \\\\\n",
    "&= Var[\\mathbf{\\sigma} \\odot \\mathbf{\\epsilon}] \\\\\n",
    "&= \\mathbf{\\sigma}^{2} Var[\\mathbf{\\epsilon}] \\\\\n",
    "&= \\mathbf{\\sigma}^{2}\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "By definition, the variance of $\\mathbf{\\epsilon}$ is equal to 1."
