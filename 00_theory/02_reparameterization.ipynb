    "## Reparameterization\n",
    "When we sample from a probability distribution, backpropagation the gradient is not possible because it is a stochastic process. To make it trainable, the reparameterization is useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume that $\\mathbf{z}$ is sampled from a gaussian distribution which the mean is $\\mathbf{\\mu}$ and the variance is $\\mathbf{\\sigma^{2}}$. Then, the mean and variance of $\\mathbf{z}$ would be $\\mathbf{\\mu}$ and $\\mathbf{\\sigma^{2}}$. Therefore, $\\mathbf{z}$ can be written as follows.\n",
